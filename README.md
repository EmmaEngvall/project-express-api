# Project Express API
This week's project is to start the backend journey by creating an API using Express. 
The API should have at least a couple of RESTful endpoints which return either an array of data or a single item.

## What you need to do
✓ The API should have at least 2 routes.
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **collection** of results (array of elements).
✓ A minimum of one endpoint to return a **single** result (single element).
✓ The API should be [RESTful](https://www.notion.so/23473abe980e40aaa932914751055d22?pvs=21).
